## Basic Style Guide


- Max line length: 120

- Spaces NOT Tabs

- 2 Spaces per indent

- Strings in 'single quotes'

- camelCase for variable names

- Use === instead of ==

- Fields generated by the UI should be prefixed with 'ui'

- Use jQuery not $

- Comments begin with a Capital letter

- Use lodash functions to handle your array/object manipulation to
avoid writing boilerplate array/object code. See - https://lodash.com/docs

- Angular Services, Controllers and any function used to construct *new* objects
should begin with a capitalized letter to denote that it is essentially a constructor function
(i.e. called with the **new** JS keyword.)

## Coding Conventions

### Before we Begin...

* This document is a work in progress and therefore it's important to note that it isn't a definitive guide to
all possible style or convention-related topics you will encounter in your development endeavours.

* This below 'best practices' are here to give you a starting point on how to structure your code moving forward.

* Of course it should be mentioned that testing your code should **always** be part of your development process and you should
consistently make best efforts to provide automated tests for any modules you develop/modify. Technical debt
(introduced when testing is not a consideration) is bad as it  drives up maintenance and development efforts moving forward.

* These tests will help you (and others) catch regression bugs on the frontend moving forward!

* You may see some assets which do not fully conform to some (or many) of the below conventions. If you do see this please
feel free to refactor them appropriately as you fix/extend functionality in these modules.


### Angular Modules

#### The Module Folder Structure
- In general modules are self contained in the  ```app/scripts``` directory.
- Each module has is named in all lowercase and is comprised of a **js**, **views**, **styles**. See below:

    ```
    module_name/
      |__ js/
      |__ views/
      |__ styles/
      |__ images/
    ```

- The **js** folder contains your angularJS controllers, services, filters, etc.
- The **views** folder contains your angularJS html templates.
- The **styles** folder contains your scss (sass) files pertaining (i.e. relevant to the styling of your html views).
- The **images** folder contains your image files relevant to the module.

#### Module Breakdown
- Modules are broken down according to the function it serves within the application. This means that your module names
should reflect the functionality provided by your module and provide a simple (relatively flat structure) to gain access
to your module's' angular assets.

- In general it is preferred that you use the ```.``` notation to separate your namespaced module from others.

  - For example if you were to create a module that provided gene set functionality your module name could be called
```geneset``` with the primary module definition (including possible application routing), *controllers*, *services*/*factories* and *directives*, *filters*, etc. being ```geneset.controllers```,
 ```geneset.services```, ```geneset.directives``` and ```geneset.filters``` respectively with each of these sub-modules
 living in their own *geneset.js*, *controllers.js*, *services.js*, *directives.js* and *filters.js* files respectively under the ```js``` folder.

#### Rationale for an Angular Flat Structure
- It could certainly be argued that it would be better to breakdown the angular assets even further (which is great for unit tests) into each individual controller, directive or service however
we feel that this may introduce too much complexity for very little payback. As such we have opted for a middle ground approach. That is either the whole module is included in
its entirety or none at all.

### Private methods and Variables

* The bad example...
    ```javascript
        // A private function --> Ensure all your comments begin with a capital letter
        function meaningOfLife() {
        }

        // A private variable
        var theMeaningOfLife = 42;
    ```

* The good example...
    ```javascript
        // A private function
        function _meaningOfLife() {
        }

        // A private variable
        var _theMeaningOfLife = 42;
    ```

### Keeping your Code Private + Code Commenting and Documentation

* The bad example - contents of secrets.js

    ```javascript
       // Without a function closure this becomes global (added to the window object in the browser!)
       var _theMeaningOfLife = 42;

       // What does this method do?
       function meaningOfLife(meaningOfLifeVal) {
          // ... some implementation details
          return _theMeaningOfLife;
       }

       /* ... Some code ... */
    ```

* The good example - contents of secrets.js

    ```javascript
       /**
        * Anonymous executed function - use this comment style for multiline comments
        * its also useful for documenting your functions - we use jsDoc syntax
        * http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html
        **/

       (function() {
            /**
            * You should always include this little guy - it will tell your browser to be more
            * watchful for common JS issues.
            **/
           'use strict';

           // without a function closure this becomes global (added to the window object in the browser!)
           var _theMeaningOfLife = 42;

          /**
           * Gets and sets the meaning of Life (this is a method description that is picked up by jsdocs).
           * @param {string} meaningOfLifeVal - The new meaning of life.
           * @returns {string} The current meaning of life.
           */
           function meaningOfLife(meaningOfLifeVal) {
              // ...
              return _theMeaningOfLife;
           }

           /* ... Some code ... */

       })();
    ```



### Referencing the ```this``` context in your Angular Services and Controllers

##### Service Context:
```javascript
var _service = this;
```

##### Controller Context:
```javascript
var _controller = this;
```
##### In General
```javascript
var _this = this;
```

### Setter/Getter Methods
```javascript
    var _meaningOfLifeVar;

    function meaningOfLife(answer) {

        if (arguments.length === 1) {
            _meaningOfLifeVar = answer;
        }

        return _meaningOfLifeVar;
    }

    console.log(meaningOfLife()); // Outputs 'undefined'
    console.log(meaningOfLife(1)); // Outputs '1'

    meaningOfLife(42);

    console.log(meaningOfLife()); // Outputs '42'
```

* In general rather then using the traditional get<Property> and set<Property> methods we are collapsing this into one
function. Why? To reduce verbose duplication of code and to map our conventions to the same one angularJS does with their getter/setters
See https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel#binding-to-a-getter-setter


### Angular Controller Conventions
* Use **controllerAs** or ```controller: 'a as b' (in the $stateProvider)``` syntax in your controller (we do this in our route definition on the parent module). This allows you to bind your controller's ```this```
(we will store this in a variable called **_controller** in our controllers --> see above) value to
functionality your view can use.
* Using this convention allows you to use **$scope** as well however **please try not to!!!** The reality is
Angular makes the controller available via the **$scope** variable irregardless so it's really your call if you have some compelling reason to use both.

* An example of a module called projects in a file called projects.js

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      'use strict';

      // Projects modules definition including dependencies
      angular.module('session', ['session.controllers', 'ui.router'])
          .constant('SOME_CONSTANT', {
            FOO_1: 'foo1', FOO_2:'foo2' // CAPITALIZE AND UNDERSCORE CONSTANTS!
          })
          .config(function ($stateProvider) {
            $stateProvider.state('sessions', {
              url: '/sessions?filters',
              templateUrl: 'scripts/session/views/session.html',
              controller: 'SessionCtrl as SessionCtrl', // <--- controller declaration!
              data: {
                tab: 'summary'
              }
            });
          })
          .run(function(someDependency1, someDependency1, ..., someDependencyN) {
            /* ... Run block implementation ... */
          });

    })();
    ```


### General Controller/Service/Directive/(Whatever) Binding Conventions
* In general for anything you would like to expose (as an API via a service/factory or to a scope) use private methods (with ```_```) to bind
your components and make this declarations at the top most portions of your components (for readability). **Note**: If you are just straight assigning a variable
you can do it inline as long as it does not span more then 3 lines.

* A Bad Example

    ```javascript
       angular.module('session.controllers', [])
           .controller('SessionCtrl', function() {
               var _controller = this;

               _controller.gotoSession = function() {
                 /* ... */
               };
               _controller.refresh = function() {
                 /* ... */
               };
               _controller.search = function() {
                 /* ... */
               };
               _controller.sessions = [];
               _controller.title = 'Sessions';
           })
           .controller('FixedSessionCtrl', function() {
              /* ... */
           });
    ```

* A Good Example

    ```javascript
      (function() {
        'use strict';

        angular.module('session.controllers', [])
           /**
            * This controller does ...
            * @requires sessionProxyService
            **/
          .controller('SessionCtrl', function(sessionProxyService) {
            var _controller = this;

            // Public Controller API
            _controller.gotoSession = _gotoSession;
            _controller.refresh = _refresh;
            _controller.search = _search;
            _controller.sessions = ['bob', 'dusan', 'terry'];
            _controller.title = 'Sessions';

            // Assign an object used by the view or a child controller.
            _controller.sessionProxyManager = sessionProxyService.sessionProxyManagerFactory();

            // Private multiline functions

            // A great candidate for using your epic JSDocs skills to document the below functions...

            function _gotoSession() {
              /* ... */
            }

            function _refresh() {
              /* ... */
            }

            function _search() {
              /* ... */
            }
          })
           /**
            * This child controller (parent: SessionCtrl) does ...
            * @requires someService
            **/
          .controller('FixedSessionCtrl', function(someService) {
            /* ... */
          });
    })();
    ```

* If you must use ```$scope``` in your controllers/directives ensure that you are at least encapsulating your
data members in coherent objects i.e. do not assign properties (non-functions) directly to the ```$scope```. This will prevent $scope prototype
inheritance issues
you might run into with child scopes used in forms, subcontrollers, and directives.

* A Bad Example

    ```javascript
        (function() {
            'use strict';

            angular.module('sessions.controller')
              .controller(function($scope) {
                var _controller = this;

                $scope.name = 'Tim Cooke';
                $scope.address = '...';
                $scope.phone = '...';

                /* ... */
              });
        })();
    ```
* A Good Example

    ```javascript
        (function() {
            'use strict';

            angular.module('users.controllers')
              .controller('UserCtrl', function($scope) {

                var _controller = this, // You can seperate your vars with commas
                    _user = {
                        name : 'Tim Cooke',
                        address: '...',
                        phone: '...'
                    };

                $scope.user = _user;

                /* ... */
              });
        })();
    ```
