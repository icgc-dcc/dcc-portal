// Inspired by https://github.com/airbnb/javascript but less opinionated.

// We use eslint-loader so even warnings are very visibile.
// This is why we only use "WARNING" level for potential errors,

// In the future, we might create a separate list of rules for production.
// It would probably be more strict.
